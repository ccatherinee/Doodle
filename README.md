This Doodle 2.0 app contains the most basic features a user encounters when adding their own availability to a Doodle poll (note that Doodle 2.0 doesn't support creating a poll). 

Key features I identified which set Doodle (and thus Doodle 2.0) apart from WhenToMeet include: 
- toggling buttons instead of "painting" 
    - being able to say yes, no OR MAYBE (not a feature of WhenToMeet)
- only being able to see/consider times the host or creator of the poll selects 
- being able to sort the dates by the number of people available or by the order of the dates (in order to trigger this feature in Doodle 2.0, simply click the "Others available" column header - this will sort the days by the "Others available" column)
